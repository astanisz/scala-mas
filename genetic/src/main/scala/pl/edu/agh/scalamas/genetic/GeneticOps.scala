/**
 * Polymorphic family of genetic operators suited for a particular solution representation.
 *
 * Implementations should specify the type of the solution and provide corresponding GeneticEvaluator
 * and GeneticTransformer operators.
 *
 * === Basic example ===
 * {{{
 *  trait MyGeneticOps extends GeneticOps[MyGeneticOps] {
 *   type Solution = MySolutionType
 *   type Evaluation = MyEvaluationType
 *
 *   def generate: MySolutionType = ...
 *   def evaluate(solution: MySolutionType): MyEvaluationType = ...
 *   def ordering: Ordering[MyEvaluationType] = ...
 *
 *   def transform(solution: MySolutionType) = ...
 *   def transform(solution1: MySolutionType, solution2: MySolutionType) = ...
 *  }
 * }}}
 *
 * === Reusing operator components ===
 *
 * You can use the cake pattern to compose different operators for a given representation, as in:
 *
 * {{{
 *  trait MyRepresentation extends GeneticOps[MyRepresentation] {
 *   type Solution = MySolutionType
 *  }
 *
 *  trait MyEvaluator extends GeneticEvaluator[MyRepresentation] {
 *   ...
 *  }
 *
 *  trait MyTransformer1 extends GeneticTransformer[MyRepresentation] {
 *   ...
 *  }
 *
 *  trait MyTransformer2 extends GeneticTransformer[MyRepresentation] {
 *   ...
 *  }
 *
 *  trait MyConcreteOps1 extends MyRepresentation with MyEvaluator with MyTransformer1
 *
 *  trait MyConcreteOps2 extends MyRepresentation with MyEvaluator with MyTransformer2
 * }}}
