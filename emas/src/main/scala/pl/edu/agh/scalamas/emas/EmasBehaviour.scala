/**
 * Default EMAS behaviour component. Agents choose a behaviour based on their available energy.
 *
 * If the energy is 0, agents die. If it is below some threshold they fight, otherwise they reproduce.
 * Agents also have some probability to migrate to another island.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - emas.reproductionThreshold - The amount of energy to start reproducing
 * - emas.migrationProbability - The probability for an agent to migrate to another island
 * - emas.deathCapacity - The size of death meetings
 * - emas.fightCapacity - The size of fight meetings
 * - emas.reproductionCapacity - The size of reproduction meetings
 * - emas.migrationCapacity - The size of migration meetings
